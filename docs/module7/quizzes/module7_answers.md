# Module 7: Answers

1.  Give an example of a control system.  What is the controller, sensor, and output?

  **A thermostat and heater is a control system.  The sensor is the thermometer, the controller is the thermostat, and the output is the temperature of the building.**

2.  Why are Open-Loop control systems used infrequently in industrial and manufacturing plants?

  **Open-Loop control systems cannot incorporate feedback from the system so they cannot compensate for errors.  Industrial processes require high-accuracy and even slight errors can result in steep costs**

3.  What are the two techniques used to transform time-domain signals to the frequency domain?

  **Laplace and Fourier Transform**

4.  If a control system oscillates rapidly for a while before converging, what is the damping of the system?

  **Underdamped**

5.  What type of damping will result the fastest convergence to the reference?

  **Critical Damping**

6.  What do PID control systems minimize?

  **The error - or the difference between the measured value and the reference value.**

7.  What is the purpose of the derivative term in PID control?

  **The derivative anticipates future changes to the error and can be used to reach convergence faster.**

8.  What is the purpose of the integral term in PID control?

  **It allows the system to account for cumulative errors that occurred over time.**

9.  What is the name of a manual approach to finding parameters for PID controller?

  **Ziegler-Nichols**

10.  What is a limitation of PID control?

  **Restricted to linear systems, does not use system-specific knowledge, cannot automatically adapt to fundamental system changes because parameters are constant.**
